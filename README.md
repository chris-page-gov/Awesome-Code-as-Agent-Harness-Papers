This repository organizes research that treats **code and its execution artifacts as the executable, inspectable, and stateful infrastructure** through which LLM agents reason, act, model environments, manage state, and verify progress. Papers are grouped along three connected layers — *Harness Interface*, *Harness Mechanisms*, and *Scaling the Harness* — and across applications such as coding assistants, GUI/OS automation, scientific discovery, embodied agents, and recommender systems.

## 🌟 Introduction

Recent large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated strong capabilities in understanding and generating code, but their role in agentic systems is shifting from *target output* to *operational substrate*. We introduce **Code as Agent Harness**: code and its execution artifacts (programs, traces, repositories, tests, sandboxes, simulators) are the executable, inspectable, and stateful infrastructure through which LLM agents operate reliably over time.

We organize the literature into three connected layers:

🔹 **Harness Interface.** How code enters the agent loop — externalizing reasoning into executable procedures, translating intent into programmable actions, and modeling environment state through program artifacts, traces, and simulations.

🔹 **Harness Mechanisms.** How a code-harnessed agent stays reliable over long horizons — planning organizes the trajectory, memory preserves task state, tool use connects to external systems, and iterative debugging turns execution failures into revision signals.

🔹 **Scaling the Harness.** How code becomes a shared workspace for multi-agent systems — coordinating roles, exchanging artifacts, reviewing each other’s outputs, and verifying collective progress through repositories, execution states, and structured workflows.

Across these layers, we synthesize methodological progress and practical applications in coding assistants, GUI/OS automation, embodied agents, scientific discovery, recommender systems, DevOps, and enterprise workflows.

## 🧩 Harness Interface

Code as the basic interface between a model and its task environment. Programs convert model outputs into executable, inspectable, and stateful structures: code makes reasoning *executable*, action *programmable*, and environment state *inspectable*.

### 💭 Code for Reasoning

Programs externalize internal logic into verifiable computation, allowing interpreters, symbolic solvers, execution traces, or process rewards to check and refine intermediate steps.

## 🛠️ Harness Mechanisms

Once code is placed inside the agent loop, the harness must decide *what to execute next*, *preserve useful state*, *expose the right tools*, and *convert failures into corrective actions*.

### 🗺️ Planning for Code Agents

Planning is harness control: it structures how the agent externalizes intent into executable steps, schedules interactions with code artifacts and tools, and regulates the trajectory of reasoning, execution, and revision over time.

### 🔧 Tool Usage for Code Agents

Tool usage is the action and observation layer of the code-agent harness: agents search repositories, inspect files, edit code, run commands, execute tests, call APIs, and verify intermediate results — all under typed schemas, sandboxes, and lifecycle hooks.

### 🧪 Feedback-Guided Iterative Debugging

Iterative debugging closes the harness loop: development environments expose feedback (compiler diagnostics, runtime errors, tests, critique), and the agent transforms these signals into diagnosis, revision, and progressively better debugging behavior.

## 👥 Scaling the Harness: Multi-Agent Code-Centric Systems

When multiple agents operate over code, the harness must coordinate roles, share intermediate artifacts, maintain common state, and verify collective progress through repositories, tests, traces, and structured workflows.

### 🎭 Functional Role Specialization

Distinct agents own slices of the shared code harness — synthesis, understanding, verification, execution, and planning.

## 🚀 Applications and Emerging Fields

Code-centric agentic systems become operational in tangible domains where code defines observable state, executable actions, persistent memory, and feedback signals.

### 💻 Code Assistants

Repositories, tests, issue threads, and development tools form a persistent program world; assistants act over it as code-centric agents.
